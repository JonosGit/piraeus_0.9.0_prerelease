Overview
================

Piraeus was designed to address a futuristic vision where complex adaptive systems could communicate in real-time with simplicity.  Piraeus simplifies how heterogenous subsystems can interact dynamically and organically using an open systems approach to real-time communications. 
The technology is linearly scalable, high throughput, economical, and extreme low latency and utilizes Microsoft Orleans to facilate on-the-fly information pathways and enable communications with simplicity and without coupling.

We have used the technology with extreme experiments with great success through our work at The Pegasus Mission.  Demonstrating bidirectional and real-time communications with complex systems, distributed intelligence, and thousands of simultaneous and geographically dispersed users.
